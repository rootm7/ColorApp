# ColorApp
Simple Color App
The color app was created for my 4 year old daughter. She doesn't like ads and I don't like constantly dealing with a child upset with ads.

I do not own or take any credit for the images and the characters they portray. All can be found online.

This app contains about 10-12 different pokemon/images to choose from. After selecting a picture,the user is taken to a color screen. A blank portrait is included for coloring.

On the color screen the user can select the color and pen size. There is a button to clear the screen and return to the previous screen.

This app does not contain ads :)
